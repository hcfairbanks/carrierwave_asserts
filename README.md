# CarrierwaveAsserts

This gem recreates similar rspec matchers for carrierwave into minitest asserts. Please see the usage section for a complete example app.

## Installation

### Dependencies

```imagemagick libmagickwand-dev```

You can install them on ubuntu as follows

```sudo apt-get install imagemagick libmagickwand-dev```


The following gems are needed

rmagick  (needs to be added in rails 5)

Minitest (included in rails 5)  

i18n     (included in rails 5)

Add the following lines to your application's Gemfile:
```ruby
gem 'rmagick'
gem 'carrierwave_asserts'
```

And then execute:

```$ bundle install```

Or install it yourself as:

```$ gem install carrierwave_asserts```

## Usage
Here is an example project using the asserts. [carrierwave_asserts example](https://github.com/hcfairbanks/carrierwave_asserts_example) 

Inside you project under the test folder create a folder uploaders.
All your uploaders should be tested in this folder.

Here is a sample uploader file

project_name/test/uploaders/picture_uploader_test.rb

##########################################################################
```
require 'test_helper'
require 'minitest/autorun'
require 'rmagick'

class PictureUploaderTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  include Magick

  setup do
    PictureUploader.enable_processing = true
    file_path = File.join( fixture_path, "files","imgs", "cat_1.jpeg")
    data_url  = "data:image/jpeg;base64,"
    data_url += Base64.encode64(File.open(file_path).read)
    cat = Cat.create(name: 'Mr Snuggles', picture: data_url)
    @uploader = PictureUploader.new(cat, :picture)
    File.open(file_path) { |f| @uploader.store!(f) }
  end

  test "img scales down landscape to fit within 200 by 133 pixels" do
    assert_be_no_larger_than(@uploader.current_path, 200, 133)
  end

  test "thumbnail scales down to exactly 100 by 67 pixels" do
    assert_have_dimensions(@uploader.thumb.current_path, 100, 67)
  end

  test "adds the correct permissions" do
    assert_have_permissions(@uploader.current_path,"700")
  end

  test "thumbnail is the same as the expected thumbnail file" do
    example = File.join(fixture_path,"files","example_imgs","thumb.jpeg")
    assert_identical_files(example,@uploader.thumb.current_path)
  end

  test "image is the same as the expected image file" do
    example = File.join(fixture_path,"files","example_imgs","cat_uploaded.jpeg")
    assert_identical_files(example,@uploader.current_path)
  end

  test "File is in the expected folder location" do
    assert_file_location(@uploader.current_path)
  end

  test "processes the thumbnail to the proper mb size" do
    assert_file_size(@uploader.thumb.current_path,65817)
  end

  test "processes the image to the proper mb size" do
    assert_file_size(@uploader.current_path,80467.0)
  end

  test "has the correct format" do
    assert_format(@uploader.current_path,"JPEG")
  end

end
